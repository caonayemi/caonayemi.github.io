        A margin, border, and padding can all serve as spacers between objects on a website. Let's back up for a moment and talk about what constitutes an object. An object is really anything on the site: an image, a text box, a heading, a button, a table, a data cell within a table, a section of color, etc. A web designer will aranges the objects to create the site you see online. But how do can we determine how much space each object takes up? Obviously, each object has a size, but that's not where the story ends. We can also determine how much space the object needs around it, creating space <i>between</i> objects. This is where our margins, borders, and padding come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the inside out, we go from the object itself out to the padding, then the border, and finally the margin. As state previously, an <b>object</b> has its own dimensions (width x height). The <b>padding</b> is the space between the object and its border. The <b>border</b>, which may be made visible by the web designer, surrounds the the object. The <b>margin</b> is the space between the border and other objects on the site. Please see the diagram below for further clarification.

      <h3>Borders for Beginners</h3>
      <p>
        Here is where I will explain borders and how you create them using CSS. For example, here is what you would get if you entered <code>border: 15px solid black;</code> or <code>border: 2px dashed white;</code> for your CSS:
      </p>
      <div id="border-example-1">
        I have a thick, solid, black border.
      </div>
      <div id="border-example-2">
        My border is thin, dashed, and white.
      </div>
      <h3>Prepping Your Padding</h3>
      <p>
        Examples of padding
      </p>
      <div id="padding-example-1">
        There is little<br>
        space between my<br>
        border and me.<br>
        <b>I feel cramped!</b>
      </div>
      <div id="padding-example-2">
        My border is<br>
        too far away.<br>
        <i>I feel lonely!</i>
      </div>
      <div id="padding-example-3">
        My padding is<br>
        just right. <i><b>I feel<br>
        like Goldilocks!</b></i>
      </div>
      <p>
        Just as with margins, we can apply our borders and padding unequally on different sides.
      </p>
      <div id="unequal-border-padding-example-1">
        My border is ridiculous! Some sides<br>
        thick, some sides thin; some solid,<br>
        one dotted, one dashed...
      </div>
      <div id="unequal-border-padding-example-2">
        How do you think I feel?<br>
        Look at my uneven padding!
      </div>
